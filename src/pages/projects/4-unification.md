We had two main customer facing apps: Kegshoe keg tracking and Kegshoe CRM. These used to be separate apps, which was harder to manage and harder to integrate. We decided to combine CRM into Kegshoe. I led part of this project (I didn't work on the mobile apps), and saw it through to completion.

This was challenging because I had to come up with a transition strategy to move customers to the new system. Features had to be moved over incrementally without breaking them and maintaining user expected functionality.
