Database design, controllers, stripe subscriptions, front-end logic and styling. Sippo was originally a hack week 3-day pilot project. We realized it had potential and were excited to work on it. It went through multiple visual and technical design revisions, and I was driving the server-side logic (Brandon did front-end).
