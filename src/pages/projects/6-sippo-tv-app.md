Sippo Firestick app for TVs. Input a display code into the app and it displays your menu on your TV. I developed this app on my own TV and phone. Sippo was designed around displays, so the app design was very simple plug-and-play. Just type in your 4-character display code and boom, your display shows up. Any settings set in Sippo are applied automatically.
