  <h1>More about me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a full stack web developer who gets excited when user-facing features
    make a direct positive impact on customers. It's satisfying and important to
    build solutions that don't just work technically, but actually improve the
    lives of the people using them.
  </p>
  <h2>Technically...</h2>
  <p>
    I like designing distributed systems and creating clean code abstractions
    that are rooted in real business domains. I'm a believer in the
    domain-driven development principles - they're a great way to ensure
    technical design decisions actually serve the real-world problems you're
    solving, not just abstract engineering ideals. Developing code architecture
    and patterns around business processes makes sure models stay closely
    mirrored to reality.
  </p>
  <h2>My work style</h2>
  <p>
    I'm easygoing, and I love a good quip or cultural reference to keep things
    fun. I thrive on candid feedback and clear, concise communication that
    matches the urgency of the situation. No sugarcoating, no beating around the
    bush - just honest guidance that helps us do better work.
  </p>
  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <div id="personal-container">

    <div>
      <p>
        When I'm not engineering, you'll find me moving in some capacity -
        lifting weights, running, biking, or any other way I can stay active.
        I've been an athlete and lifter for years, and that discipline carries
        over into how I approach development challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love reading! I'm into economics, political and social systems theory,
        and sci-fi and dystopian novels. I try to keep up with our rapidly
        shifting world where it feels like the ground moves every week.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    I want to help design and build a better world, and explore the biggest
    questions and unknowns. I'm excited about the possibilities the future
    holds, and hope to have the wisdom to realize it responsibly.
